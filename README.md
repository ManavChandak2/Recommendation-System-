# Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/ManavChandak2/Recommendation-System-.git
cd Recommendation-System-
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
Ensure you have the required data files in the data/ directory.
The similarity model (similarity.pkl) should be present in the root directory.
To run the recommendation system:
python main.py

#Model Description
This recommendation system is built using collaborative filtering techniques. It leverages user-item interaction data to identify patterns and provide personalized recommendations. The similarity model is used to compute the similarity between items, enhancing the recommendation quality.

#Data
The dataset used in this project consists of user ratings and item information. The primary files are:
user_ratings.csv: Contains user IDs, item IDs, and ratings.
item_data.csv: Contains item IDs and additional item attributes.

#File Descriptions
data/: Contains the dataset files.
models/: Contains the recommendation model code.
utils/: Contains utility scripts for data processing and other helper functions.
similarity.pkl: Pre-trained similarity model.
main.py: The main script to run the recommendation system.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

#Results
The recommendation system provides top-N recommendations for users based on their past interactions and item similarities. Detailed evaluation metrics and performance results will be added here.
